**Hey, I'm Charlie! ðŸ˜Ž**
Iâ€™m a self taught UI Designer, Game Designer, Programmer, Composer, Creative Director, and Project Manager. I have a passion for learning and teaching. I've started 2 game development education services and I love sharing my knowledge with others. If you ever need a mentor in any of the things I listed above, hit me up! I currently develop for the roblox platform. I also work on indie games with the love of my life in our game studio [Flamingo Games](https://flamingogames.co/).
